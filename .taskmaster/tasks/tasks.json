        "title": "Fix Dashboard Design to Match Current Theme",
        "description": "Update the dashboard design to match the modern, slick aesthetic of the current application theme and ensure visual consistency across all components.",
        "details": "- Analyze the current design system and color scheme used in the main application\n- Update dashboard layout, typography, and spacing to match the existing design\n- Ensure proper use of Tailwind CSS classes consistent with the rest of the app\n- Implement modern UI patterns like proper card layouts, hover effects, and smooth transitions\n- Fix any visual inconsistencies in the dashboard components\n- Ensure responsive design works properly across all screen sizes\n- Update navigation and sidebar styling to match the main app design\n<info added on 2025-06-28T02:48:01.237Z>\nIncorporate a detailed design system audit into the dashboard update. The new changes will align the dashboard with the main application by using a dark gradient background with a subtle grid overlay (via the dark-gradient-bg class) instead of a plain bg-gray-900. Update cards from bg-gray-800 to a glass morphism style (using a dark-card class with backdrop blur and the specified bg-card rgba overlay) to match the modern aesthetic. Integrate interactive hover effects with scale transforms and smooth transitions, and update typography to use Michroma for section titles while preserving Geist for body text. Replace existing button styles with gradient buttons (transitioning from purple (#8b5cf6) to pink (#ec4899)) and enforce a consistent 6-unit spacing pattern. Adjust border styling to use subtle white opacity borders (rgba(255,255,255,0.08)) and enhance the sidebar with glass morphism effects to maintain visual consistency across the dashboard.\n</info added on 2025-06-28T02:48:01.237Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-28T02:52:30.408Z>\nDashboard Design Updates Completed:\n\n• Main Dashboard Page (src/app/dashboard/page.tsx):\n  - Updated to use the dark-card class for a glass morphism effect.\n  - Applied consistent typography classes (hero-title, section-title, text-primary, text-secondary, text-muted).\n  - Added hover effects with hover:scale-105 transitions and smooth color transitions.\n  - Implemented gradient backgrounds for icons and buttons.\n  - Incorporated an animate-bounce animation for the empty state.\n  \n• Dashboard Layout (src/components/DashboardLayout.tsx):\n  - Set the background to utilize the dark-gradient-bg class.\n  - Applied glass morphism to the sidebar using dark-card and backdrop-blur-xl.\n  - Standardized navigation with consistent hover states and scaling effects.\n  - Enhanced wallet button styling with gradient backgrounds and scale transforms.\n  - Improved the mobile overlay by adding a backdrop blur.\n  \n• Dashboard Layout Wrapper (src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx):\n  - Updated loading and error states to reflect the current design system with proper background gradients and card styling.\n  \n• Tokens Page (src/app/dashboard/tokens/page.tsx):\n  - Standardized the design system across components.\n  - Applied glass morphism cards with relevant hover effects.\n  - Enhanced filter and sort controls with consistent styling.\n  - Improved token cards with scaling animations and gradient icons.\n  - Updated the empty state with a bounce animation to draw attention.\n\nThese updates ensure the dashboard now fully aligns with the modern, sleek aesthetic of the main application through the use of dark gradients, glass morphism, consistent typography, and interactive design enhancements.\n</info added on 2025-06-28T02:52:30.408Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-28T02:55:24.654Z>\nFinal Dashboard Design Updates - COMPLETED ✅\n\nAll new dashboard pages have been updated to fully align with the modern design system:\n\n1. Create Token Page (src/app/dashboard/create-token/page.tsx):\n   - Header now uses hero-title and text-primary.\n   - Form container updated with dark-card and rounded-xl.\n   - Consistent typography applied using text-secondary.\n\n2. Clone Token Page (src/app/dashboard/clone-token/page.tsx):\n   - Header updated with proper typography classes.\n   - Glass morphism applied to all cards and containers.\n   - Refresh button enhanced with hover scaling effects.\n   - Info card updated with gradient styling and consistent design.\n   - Token cards improved with hover animations and scaling.\n   - Bounce animation added for empty/error states.\n   - Action buttons enhanced with scale effects.\n\n3. Wallets Page (src/app/dashboard/wallets/page.tsx):\n   - Header typography updated to match the design system.\n   - Wallet card updated with glass morphism and group hover effects.\n   - Wallet icon enhanced with scale animation on hover.\n   - Wallet stats cards receive hover scaling.\n   - Security section styling standardized.\n   - Supported wallets grid enhanced with hover effects.\n\nComplete design system implementation now includes:\n- Consistent use of glass morphism cards (dark-card) across all dashboard pages.\n- Uniform typography hierarchy (hero-title, section-title, text-primary, text-secondary, text-muted).\n- Consistent hover effects with hover:scale-105 and smooth transitions.\n- Modern rounded corners (rounded-xl) throughout.\n- Gradient backgrounds and full color scheme alignment.\n- Responsive design maintained across all components.\n- Interactive elements enhanced with proper animations.\n\nVisual consistency has been achieved across the dashboard, ensuring it perfectly matches the application’s modern, slick aesthetic with dark gradients, glass morphism effects, uniform spacing, and smooth transitions.\n</info added on 2025-06-28T02:55:24.654Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-28T02:57:29.800Z>\nLayout Issues Fixed: Resolved missing CSS class definitions and corrected border styling. The following updates have been made:\n• In src/app/globals.css, added the missing .purple-light { color: var(--purple-light); } and .text-purple-light { color: var(--purple-light); } classes while ensuring all CSS variables are properly defined.\n• In src/components/DashboardLayout.tsx, replaced instances of border-subtle with border-white/10 to standardize border styling. Adjustments were made to sidebar, header, and navigation for proper glass morphism and backdrop blur effects.\nThese changes ensure the dark gradient background, consistent Michroma typography, smooth hover effects, and uniform purple/pink gradient theme are now correctly applied across the dashboard with full responsive support.\n</info added on 2025-06-28T02:57:29.800Z>",

Each wallet will have a generated public and private key pair, with private keys stored securely using strong encryption (e.g., AES-256). The implementation should include: \n1. UI integration within the dashboard for wallet management (creation, deletion, import/export). \n2. Backend functions that generate key pairs, handle secure encryption and decryption, and store wallet data in Supabase. \n3. Use environment variables to manage encryption keys and ensure private keys are never stored in plaintext. \n4. Proper error handling and validation to restrict wallet creation to a maximum of 10 per user. \n5. Integration with the existing Supabase authentication (from Task 2 and Task 4) to ensure that wallet operations are only available for authenticated users.",
